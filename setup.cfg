# declare your scripts
# If you want to create any Python executables in bin/, define them here.
# This is a three-step process:
#
# 1. Create the function you want to run on the CLI in src/sagemaker/hyperpod/cli/cli.py
#    For convenience I usually recommend calling it main()
#
# 2. Uncomment this section of the setup.cfg options; this will create
#    bin/HyperpodCLI (which you can obviously change!) as a script
#    that will call your main() function, above.
#
# console_scripts =
#     HyperpodCLI = hyperpod_cli.cli:main
#
# 3. Uncomment the Python interpreter and Python-setuptools in the
#   dependencies section of your Config. This is necessary to guarantee the
#   presence of a runtime interpreter and for the script generated by
#   setuptools to find its function.

# Configuration for pytest; enable coverage for HyperpodCLI, emit
# XML, HTML, and terminal reports.
