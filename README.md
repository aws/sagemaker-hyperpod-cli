## Overview

The SageMaker HyperPod CLI is a tool that helps submit training jobs to the Amazon SageMaker HyperPod clusters orchestrated by Amazon EKS. It provides a set of commands for managing the full lifecycle of training jobs, including submitting, describing, listing, patching and canceling jobs, as well as accessing logs and executing commands within the job's containers. The CLI is designed to abstract away the complexity of working directly with Kubernetes for these core actions of managing jobs on SageMaker HyperPod clusters orchestrated by Amazon EKS.

## Prerequisites

- HyperPod CLI currently only supports starting kubeflow/PyTorchJob. To start a job, you need to install Kubeflow Training Operator first. 
  - You can either follow [kubeflow public doc](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/training/installation/) to install it.
  - Or you can follow the [Readme under helm_chart folder](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-hyperpod-cli/blob/main/helm_chart/readme.md) to install Kubeflow Training Operator.
- Configure [aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) to point to the correct region where your HyperPod clusters are located. 

## Platform Support

SageMaker HyperPod CLI currently supports Linux and MacOS platforms. Windows platform is not supported now.

## ML Framework Support

SageMaker HyperPod CLI currently supports start training job with:
- PyTorch ML Framework. Version requirements: PyTorch >= 1.10

## Installation

1. Make sure that your local python version is 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 or 3.11.

1. Install ```helm```.

    The SageMaker Hyperpod CLI uses Helm to start training jobs. See also the [Helm installation guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

    ```
    curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
    chmod 700 get_helm.sh
    ./get_helm.sh
    rm -f ./get_helm.sh  
    ```

1. Clone and install the sagemaker-hyperpod-cli package.

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:aws/sagemaker-hyperpod-cli.git
    cd sagemaker-hyperpod-cli
    pip install .
    ```

1. Verify if the installation succeeded by running the following command.

    ```
    hyperpod --help
    ```

1. If you have a running HyperPod cluster, you can try to run a training job using the sample configuration file provided at ```/examples/basic-job-example-config.yaml```.
    - Get your HyperPod clusters to show their capacities.
      ```
      hyperpod get-clusters
      ```
    - Get your HyperPod clusters to show their capacities and quota allocation info for a team.
      ```
      hyperpod get-clusters -n hyperpod-ns-<team-name>
      ```
    - Connect to one HyperPod cluster and specify a namespace you have access to.
      ```
      hyperpod connect-cluster --cluster-name <cluster-name>
      ```
    - Start a job in your cluster. Change the `instance_type` in the yaml file to be same as the one in your HyperPod cluster. Also change the `namespace` you want to submit a job to, the example uses kubeflow namespace. You need to have installed PyTorch in your cluster.
      ```
      hyperpod start-job --config-file ./examples/basic-job-example-config.yaml
      ```
