# Building, Packaging, and Testing Helm Charts

This guide walks cluster Admin users through the process of creating, packaging, and testing HyperPod Helm chart. More information in the official AWS documentation [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-hyperpod-eks-install-packages-using-helm-chart.html).

## 1. Set Up Your Helm Environment

Before starting, make sure Helm is installed on your machine. You can install Helm using the following commands:

```bash
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh
```

## 2. Package structure

Here are the list of dependent charts and plugins that can be installed as part of the HyperPod Helm chart. Features required for HyperPod Resiliency as mentioned below are recommended to enable cluster resiliency. Features required for HyperPod Task Governance as mentioned below are optional but help set access control on your cluster.

More information about HyperPod task governance [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-hyperpod-eks-operate-console-ui-governance.html).

The following plugins are only required for HyperPod Resiliency if you are using the following supported devices, such as GPU/Neuron instances, unless you install these plugins on your own. 

| Plugin Name                   | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                   | Required For | Enable by default |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| neuron-device-plugin         | Deploys the AWS Neuron device plugin for Kubernetes, enabling support for AWS Inferentia chips to accelerate machine learning model inference workloads.                                | HyperPod Resiliency with AWS Neuron             | Yes               |
| aws-efa-k8s-device-plugin    | This plugin enables AWS Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) metrics on the EKS clusters.                                                                                                        | HyperPod Resiliency with AWS EFA             | Yes               |
| nvidia-device-plugin         | This plugin is a Daemon set that exposes number of GPUs on each node, keeps track health metrics, and enables running GPU enabled containers in EKS clusters.                                 | HyperPod Resiliency with Nvidia GPUs             | Yes               |

If you install these plugins on your own, make sure that the following configurations are set to work with your HyperPod EKS clusters:

Tolerations (across all plugins):
```
- key: sagemaker.amazonaws.com/node-health-status
  operator: Equal
  value: Unschedulable
  effect: NoSchedule
```

Node Affinities (for neuron and nvidia plugins):
```
affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
            - key: "node.kubernetes.io/instance-type"
              operator: In
              values:
                - <your HyperPod instance types>
```

Supported Instance Labels (for efa plugin):
Set this in your values.yaml
```
supportedInstanceLabels:
    values:
     - <your HyperPod instance types>
```

## 3. Test the Chart Locally

To ensure that your chart is properly defined, use the helm lint command:

```
helm lint helm_chart/HyperPodHelmChart

```

## 4. Deployment

Notes:
1. To use the resiliency feature in SageMaker HyperPod cluster with Amazon EKS, you need to first install this HelmChart to EKS cluster before creating HyperPod cluster.

2. MLflow, and other optional components are disabled by default. If you wish to enable them, you'll need to manually update the values.yaml file in the main chart by setting the corresponding feature flags to true.

3. Below <dependencies> is the default release name. helm install <dependencies> is the example.

### Step Zero:
* Update kubeconfig file to connect to your EKS cluster.
  ```
  aws eks update-kubeconfig --name <eks_cluster_name>
  ```
* Verify you are connected to your EKS cluster.
  ```
  kubectl config current-context
  ```

### Step One:

* Update helm chart dependencies. It ensures that all the sub-charts required by the main chart are fetched and properly set up before deploying the main chart. It doesn’t actually deploy the chart itself but prepares it by ensuring all dependencies are resolved.

  ```
  helm dependencies update helm_chart/HyperPodHelmChart
  ```

### Step Two:

* Simulate the installation process. Below command shows you what would be installed and the configuration that would be applied. 
  ```
  helm install dependencies helm_chart/HyperPodHelmChart --namespace kube-system --dry-run
  ```

* If the resource already exists, avoid running the install command again, as it may cause conflicts. Instead, use the following command to upgrade the existing release while preserving the current configuration. This ensures that your current settings are maintained without overwriting them.
  - To find all your releases deployed in one namespace (eg. kube-system), run:
    ```
    helm list --namespace kube-system
    ```
  - To upgrade the existing release deployed in one namespace (eg. kube-system), run:
    ```
    helm upgrade <release_name> helm_chart/HyperPodHelmChart --reuse-values --namespace kube-system
    ```

### Step Three:

* Deploy a Helm Chart to Your Kubernetes Cluster. This command deploys the Helm chart to your cluster with custom configurations applied, as specified in the values.yaml file. Please note that only certain versions of dependencies will be deployed based on the configuration specified in the values.yaml.
  ```
  helm install dependencies helm_chart/HyperPodHelmChart --namespace kube-system
  ```


## 5. Create Team Role

* To create role for hyperpod cluster users, please set the value for `computeQuotaTarget.targetId` when installing or upgrade the chart. This value is the same as the `targetId` of quota allocation.
  ```
  helm install dependencies helm_chart/HyperPodHelmChart --namespace kube-system --set computeQuotaTarget.targetId=<target_id>
  ```
### Step Four (whenever you want to upgrade the installation of helm charts):
* This command is required to upgrade the helm chart installation on your cluster, which will also help consume the latest releases of service components like Health Monitoring Agent.
```
helm upgrade dependencies helm_chart/HyperPodHelmChart --namespace kube-system
```

* To install the sub-chart separately that only contains roles and role bindings
  ```
  helm install dependencies helm_chart/HyperPodHelmChart/charts/team-role-and-bindings --set computeQuotaTarget.targetId=<target_id>
  ```

## 6. Notes
- Training job auto resume is expected to work with Kubeflow training operator release v1.7.0, v1.8.0, v1.8.1 https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/releases
- The Health Monitoring Agent now automatically selects the correct container image URI based on your AWS region. The Helm chart intelligently detects the region from your Kubernetes cluster context.

- **Intelligent Region Detection**: The chart automatically detects your AWS region using multiple methods:
  1. **Explicit region setting** (highest priority): `--set health-monitoring-agent.region=us-east-1`
  2. **Global region setting**: `--set global.region=us-east-1`
  3. **Kubernetes cluster context detection**: Automatically extracts region from:
     - EKS API server URL patterns
     - Node topology labels (`topology.kubernetes.io/region`)
     - AWS provider IDs in node specifications
     - Legacy region labels (`failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region`)
  4. **Default fallback region**: us-east-1

- **Manual Region Override**: If needed, you can still specify a region manually:
  ```bash
  helm install dependencies helm_chart/HyperPodHelmChart --namespace kube-system --set health-monitoring-agent.region=us-west-2
  ```

- **Debug Mode**: Enabled by default, to troubleshoot region detection and image selection:
  ```bash
  # Disable debug mode during installation
  helm install dependencies helm_chart/HyperPodHelmChart --namespace kube-system --set health-monitoring-agent.debug=false
  
  # Or upgrade existing installation with debug disabled
  helm upgrade dependencies helm_chart/HyperPodHelmChart --namespace kube-system --set health-monitoring-agent.debug=false
  ```

- **Viewing Debug Information**: When debug mode is enabled, detailed information is stored in a ConfigMap:
  ```bash
  # View debug information (clean output)
  kubectl get configmap health-monitoring-agent-debug -n aws-hyperpod -o jsonpath='{.data.debug-info\.txt}'
  
  # View full ConfigMap details
  kubectl get configmap health-monitoring-agent-debug -n aws-hyperpod -o yaml
  ```

- **Debug Information Includes**:
  - Image tag selection process (component-specific settings)
  - Region detection methods attempted (EKS API server URL, node labels)
  - Number of nodes found and labels checked
  - Final region determination and account ID mapping
  - Generated image URI
  - Timestamp of debug information generation

- **Custom Image Override**: For advanced use cases, you can still override the image URI completely:
  ```bash
  helm install dependencies helm_chart/HyperPodHelmChart --namespace kube-system --set health-monitoring-agent.hmaimage=""
  ```

- **Supported Regions and their ECR URIs**:

## 7. Troubleshooting

#### ServiceAccount "neuron-device-plugin" in namespace "kube-system" exists and cannot be imported into the current release
- This means dependencies already installed. You can change the name of the dependencies if you want another dependencies. To see dependencies already existed or not
  ```
  kubectl get serviceaccount neuron-device-plugin -n kube-system

  NAME                   SECRETS   AGE
  neuron-device-plugin   0         9m48s
  ```

#### Add new dependencies subchart
- Make sure you run 
  ```
  helm lint HyperPodHelmChart
  ```
- Add chart metadata in the main Chart.yaml. Version should points to subchart major version.
  ```
  name: storage
  version: "0.1.0"
  repository: "file://charts/storage"
  condition: storage.enabled
  ```
