# Building, Packaging, and Testing Helm Charts

This guide walks cluster Admin users through the process of creating, packaging, and testing HyperPod Helm chart.

## 1. Set Up Your Helm Environment

Before starting, make sure Helm is installed on your machine. You can install Helm using the following commands:

```bash
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh
```

## 2. Package structure

| Chart Name                   | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                   | Enable by default |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Cluster role and binding     | Defines cluster-wide roles and bindings for Kubernetes resources, allowing cluster administrators to assign and manage permissions across the entire cluster.                           | No                |
| Team role and binding        | Defines cluster and namespaced roles and bindings, allowing cluster administrators to create scientist roles with sufficient permissions to submit jobs to the accessible teams.        | No                |

## 3. Test the Chart Locally

To ensure that your chart is properly defined, use the helm lint command:

```
helm lint helm_chart/HyperPodHelmChart

```

## 4. Deployment

Notes:
1. To use the resiliency feature in SageMaker HyperPod cluster with Amazon EKS, you need to first install this HelmChart to EKS cluster before creating HyperPod cluster.

2. MLflow, and other optional components are disabled by default. If you wish to enable them, you'll need to manually update the values.yaml file in the main chart by setting the corresponding feature flags to true.

3. Below <dependencies> is the default release name. helm install <dependencies> is the example.

### Step Zero:
* Update kubeconfig file to connect to your EKS cluster.
  ```
  aws eks update-kubeconfig --name <eks_cluster_name>
  ```
* Verify you are connected to your EKS cluster.
  ```
  kubectl config current-context
  ```

### Step One:

* Update helm chart dependencies. It ensures that all the sub-charts required by the main chart are fetched and properly set up before deploying the main chart. It doesnâ€™t actually deploy the chart itself but prepares it by ensuring all dependencies are resolved.

  ```
  helm dependencies update helm_chart/HyperPodHelmChart
  ```

### Step Two:

* Simulate the installation process. Below command shows you what would be installed and the configuration that would be applied. 
  ```
  helm install dependencies helm_chart/HyperPodHelmChart --namespace kube-system --dry-run
  ```

* If the resource already exists, avoid running the install command again, as it may cause conflicts. Instead, use the following command to upgrade the existing release while preserving the current configuration. This ensures that your current settings are maintained without overwriting them.
  - To find all your releases deployed in one namespace (eg. kube-system), run:
    ```
    helm list --namespace kube-system
    ```
  - To upgrade the existing release deployed in one namespace (eg. kube-system), run:
    ```
    helm upgrade <release_name> helm_chart/HyperPodHelmChart --reuse-values --namespace kube-system
    ```

### Step Three:

* Deploy a Helm Chart to Your Kubernetes Cluster. This command deploys the Helm chart to your cluster with custom configurations applied, as specified in the values.yaml file. Please note that only certain versions of dependencies will be deployed based on the configuration specified in the values.yaml.
  ```
  helm install dependencies helm_chart/HyperPodHelmChart --namespace kube-system
  ```

## 5. Create Team Role

* To create role for hyperpod cluster users, please set the value for `computeQuotaTarget.targeId` when installing or upgrade the chart. This value is the same as the `targeId` of quota allocation.
  ```
  helm install dependencies helm_chart/HyperPodHelmChart --namespace kube-system --set computeQuotaTarget.targetId=<target_id>
  ```
### Step Four (whenever you want to upgrade the installation of helm charts):
* This command is required to upgrade the helm chart installation on your cluster, which will also help consume the latest releases of service components like Health Monitoring Agent.
```
helm upgrade dependencies helm_chart/HyperPodHelmChart --namespace kube-system
```

* To install the sub-chart separately that only contains roles and role bindings
  ```
  helm install dependencies helm_chart/HyperPodHelmChart/charts/team-role-and-bindings --set computeQuotaTarget.targetId=<target_id>
  ```

## 6. Notes
- Training job auto resume is expected to work with Kubeflow training operator release v1.7.0, v1.8.0, v1.8.1 https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/releases
- If you intend to use the Health Monitoring Agent container image from another region, please see below list to find relevant region's URI.

## 7. Troubleshooting

#### ServiceAccount "neuron-device-plugin" in namespace "kube-system" exists and cannot be imported into the current release
- This means dependencies already installed. You can change the name of the dependencies if you want another dependencies. To see dependencies already existed or not
  ```
  kubectl get serviceaccount neuron-device-plugin -n kube-system

  NAME                   SECRETS   AGE
  neuron-device-plugin   0         9m48s
  ```

#### Add new dependencies subchart
- Make sure you run 
  ```
  helm lint HyperPodHelmChart
  ```
- Add chart metadata in the main Chart.yaml. Version should points to subchart major version.
  ```
  name: storage
  version: "0.1.0"
  repository: "file://charts/storage"
  condition: storage.enabled
  ```
