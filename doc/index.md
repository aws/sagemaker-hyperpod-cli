```{admonition} What's New
:class: important

ðŸš€ We are excited to announce general availability of Amazon SageMaker HyperPod CLI and SDK!


**Major Updates**:
- **Distributed Training**: Scale PyTorch jobs across multiple nodes and GPUs with simplified management and automatic fault tolerance.
- **Model Inference**: Deploy pre-trained models from SageMaker JumpStart and host custom auto-scaling inference endpoints.
- **Observability**: Connect to and manage multiple HyperPod clusters with enhanced monitoring capabilities.
- **Usability Improvements**: Intuitive CLI for quick experimentation and cluster management, granular SDK control over workload configurations and easy access to system logs and observability dashboards for efficient debugging

```
