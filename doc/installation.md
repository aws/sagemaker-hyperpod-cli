## Installation Options

### Install from PyPI

It's recommended to install the SageMaker HyperPod CLI and SDK in a Python virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other packages:
```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv {venv-name}

# Activate the virtual environment
source {venv-name}/bin/activate
```
```{note}
Remember to activate your virtual environment (source {venv-name}/bin/activate) each time you want to use the HyperPod CLI and SDK if you chose the virtual environment installation method.
```
You can install the SageMaker HyperPod CLI and SDK directly using `pip`:

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install sagemaker-hyperpod
```

To verify that the installation was successful, run:

```bash
# Verify CLI installation
hyp --help
```
